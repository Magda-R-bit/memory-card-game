# Memory Cards 

Memory Cards Game is a fun and interactive web-based game designed for anyone looking to improve their memory skills. By matching pairs of cards, players can challange themselves and enhance their concentration while enjoying an engaging experience. 
The game consists of 18 cards (9 pairs). Before starting, players can read the rules by clicking the "How to Play" button.

Players have the option to start the game by clicking the "Start" button or simply flipping any card. Once the first pair of cards is clicked, a timer begins, and moves are tracked. Players can pause the game or restart it at any time, making it easy to take breaks and try again.
